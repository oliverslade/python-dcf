# Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Calculation Script

## What is a Discounted Cash Flow Calculation?

Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) is a valuation method used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. The process involves forecasting the total amount of future cash flows and then discounting them back to the present value, using a discount rate that reflects the opportunity cost, cost of capital and the return expected from the investment. This approach helps in understanding the intrinsic value of a company, asset, or project based on its ability to generate cash flows in the future. 

The main components of a DCF calculation include:
- **Future Cash Flows**: This represents the cash that is expected to be generated over a certain period.
- **Terminal Value**: The value of the company after the forecast period.
- **Discount Rate**: The rate used to 'discount' future cash flows back to the present value, reflecting the opportunity cost and time value of money.

## How to Run the Script

To run this script, ensure you have Python installed on your machine and open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the repository where the script is located, and run the script using Python by typing:
   ```
   python DCF.py
   ```

## How to Use the Answer

The script calculates the intrinsic value per share of a company by performing a DCF analysis with the given parameters. After running the script, it will display the intrinsic value per share formatted as a currency. This value represents the estimated 'fair' value of one share of the company based on the future cash flows it is expected to generate.

Here's how to interpret and use the answer:
- **Intrinsic Value Per Share**: This is the result printed at the end of the script execution. It represents the estimated value of each share based on the DCF calculation.
- **Investment Decision**: Compare the intrinsic value per share with the current market price of the share. If the intrinsic value is higher than the market price, it might indicate that the stock is undervalued and potentially a good buy. Conversely, if the market price is higher, it might suggest the stock is overvalued.

Modify the initial parameters in the script to suit the specific company you wish to perform analysis on.
